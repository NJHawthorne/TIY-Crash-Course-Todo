#To-do List

###The purpose of this assignment is to build in the javascript to make a working to-do list website. The HTML and CSS have already been provided, so it's simply a matter of making the site function.

##These are the base files needed to run through the Front-End crash course at TIY-Austin. In addition to these, I would also recommend a couple of other things to download:

### [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/download) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
#### You will definitely need some kind of text editor. These are just a couple of options that I am both familiar with and would recommend over the competition. If you prefer the text editor with the least amount of colors, I would recommend Sublime, simply because Atom winds up making your code look like skittles (not a bad thing!).

###[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/)
####For the purposes of this course, you should definitely be using Google Chrome. It's a fast enough web browser, but what makes it the best choice is its web developer tools. 

###[Web Developer Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-developer/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm/related)
####This one is more optional than anything else, but I'm still listing it for those curious. This extension can help manipulate websites, from modifying the styles, size, and some of the html tags. Again, purely optional, but it has some utility once you start using it.
